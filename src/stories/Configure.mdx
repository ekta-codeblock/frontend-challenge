# Graph Visualization Guide

This document provides an overview of how to use and configure the graph component in this project.

## What is a Graph?
A graph is a visual representation of data that shows the relationship between variables. In this project, the graph component is designed to plot mathematical functions and visualize how they change based on user input.

## Features
- Supports plotting non-linear functions (e.g., sine, cosine, exponential, logarithmic)
- Interactive: users can adjust parameters and see the curve update in real time
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## How to Use
1. Import the graph component into your Vue file:
   ```js
   import CurveGraph from '../components/CurveGraph/CurveGraph.vue';
   ```
2. Add the component to your template:
   ```vue
   <CurveGraph :functionType="'sin'" :amplitude="1" :frequency="1" />
   ```
3. Adjust the props to change the curve type, amplitude, frequency, or other parameters as needed.
